## Creative Portion Descriptions

There are four main portions:
1. Jump: User can jump to any year or month they want using just a button.
2. Color Tags: User can choose a color tag for their event just like how Google Calendar works. It's very easy to mark important things or however the user would like to use them.
3. Events are sorted when displayed: Events on every day slots are sorted by time.
4. Find events: Just by clicking the button of Find, you can find the events you seek for.
